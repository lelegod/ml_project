    "Our prediction target for the regression is the mass attribute, as we stated it in our previous report. The mass will be predicted based on the following attributes: distance, stellar_magnitude, orbital_radius, orbital_period, eccentricity and radius attributes. This choice is based on our previous analysis and research of the dataset where we found that the mass could potentially have a high importance in predicting the planet type which we predict for our classification task.\n",

    "\n",
    "Additionally, the mass attribute was found to be less correlated with other variables than most other attributes (e.g. orbital period and orbital radius) which makes it a more interesting target for our Neural Network regression.\n",
    "[Correlation Matrix relevant part could be added...]\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make our data suitable for regression tasks, we needed to do a few transformations. First of all, the mass attribute was stored in 2 separate attributes: mass_wrt, and mass_multiplier. This way the mass was always stored relative to Earth or Jupiter in the original dataset. To unify this, we converted the masses to kg and created a single mass variable. The same process was repeated for the radius_multiplier and radius_wrt attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some attributes were excluded, as their meaning is not clear for such a task: Even though detection_method, and discovery_year is part of our attribute list, it is not aligned with our objective as it is not a planetary characteristic, more of an artifact of the observation and categorization. Because of this reason such variables were considered to be irrelevant for this task.\n",
    "Moreover the attribute orbital_period was also excluded from the list of attributes because of its extreme correlation with orbital_radius. Based on some test runs with including this attribute we found that this makes the model unstable, possibly due to both of the attributes pushing the model in the same direction and distorting the importance of the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to include planet_type in our attributes, as it can serve as a useful indicator of the plant properties. We needed to transform this variable because of its categorical nature. For this we used one of K encoding, so that each planet type has its own column in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After these preparatory steps we standardized the data. It is important to highlight here that for the regression task both our features and our target variable was standardized. This choice was based on the scale of our mass attribute, which due to being calculated in kg-s, moves around the range of 10^20. This can lead into anomalies during the training (calculations with such numbers could more easily lead into overflows). We made sure to only standardize the numerical attributes, and leave the one of K encoded planet types as is.\n",
    "Wherever we used cross-validation, we made sure to do the standardization for each fold separately, to get accurate and fair results for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important point is that the training and validation data has been standardized separately. This is to make sure that no information from the validation set leaks into the training set, which could happen if we standardize the whole dataset beforehand. In such scenario the mean and the variance is calculated on the whole dataset too which includes the samples from the validation set. Thus the model would be able to access this information indirectly based on the new scale of the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim is to compare multiple methods for the regression task to see which one performs the best. Whenever we evaluate the optimal model, we use a separate validation set.\n",
    "First, we ran a linear regression model with a 10 fold cross validation setup to see if it can capture the relationship between the data. Our goal\n",

    "As visible on the plot the linear regression model fails to capture the validation data as well as the train data. There is a visible difference on the validation and the training error. This indicates overfitting on the training set, as the model is not able to generalize the knowledge to the validation set, this means that the parameters of the model are tuned to the data it was trained on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our conclusion is that linear regression is not the best approach for our problem.\n",
    "This is a logical result when we look deeper into the attributes: The mass is not in a linear relationship with the other attributes. As it is also stated in Kepler's laws (which can be used for planet mass estimation if there is a moon or a spacecraft in orbit of the planet): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion the relationship between some of these attributes is already quadratic or third degree. Additionally, there is no clear equation that would describe the relationships between our input and target attributes directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time it is also observable that regularization helps with limiting the generalization error. As we increase lambda, the generalization error drops, then starts increasing while the training error steadily increases as we include higher and higher lambdas. This is a direct consequence of how regularization is applied, as it \"forces\" the weights away from the overfitting solution. However, if the lambda parameter is too high, it prevents the model from capturing the data ans the proportion of the regularization penalty in the error becomes the dominant factor.\n",

    "As we observable on the plot there are clearly a few attributes that have a higher (in absolute value) coefficient. The most dominant is the coefficient for the radius. This is in line with our previous analysis, where we investigated the correlation between different numerical attributes. Here we observed that the target attribute (mass) has the strongest correlation with the radius attribute. The other 5 coefficients are signifcantly smaller which is again in sync with the observations from our correlation.\n",

    "Moreover, it is also an interesting finding that the planet types have a meaningful influence. Particularly, the gas giants have a strong negative influence. This is in line with the expectation that gas giants have a smaller density than rocky planets. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4156706/). As a direct consequence for such large gas planets the radius is going to be also large, but the information on its type 'rebalances' the weight estimation in the regression model with a strong negative direction: as the type also indirectly indicates that the planet is likely to have a smaller density. On the other hand it is clearly visible for the rocky planets that their type adds a positive nudge to the weight estimation, as their density is a lot higher.\n",

    "We conclude that the coefficients are in line with our expectations which is also supported by our previous findings regarding the radius and literature on the planet types."
